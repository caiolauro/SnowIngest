*Terraforming - AWS I*

#1 Create 2 Buckets snowflake-tf-infra + web-app-stage

*Terraforming - Snowflake I*

!!!Change Backend S3 bucket!!!

#2 Create Snowflake Database + Schema

#3 Create File Formats (CSV + JSON)

*Snowflake Console*
#4 Create Tables to be Ingested + View



*Terraforming - AWS II*

Explanation:
We need to build the bridge between AWS S3 Bucket and Snowflake. This is called Storage Integration.
For that, we need to create a IAM Role with read and write permissions into the bucket we wanna read from Snowflake.

1) Create Policy with Access Policies in S3


2) Create Role 
	- *without condition statement and assumer_principals_arn_list without snowflake user*
	- attaching policy document of step 1

3) Create Snwoflake Storage Integration indicating ARN Role

	- Using ACCOUNT ADMIN, check  SNF SI External ID and User ARN 
	- Grant USAGE on Storage integration to SYSADMIN or create Stage with ACCOUNTADMIN

4) Go back to 'cross_account_assume_role_policy' and add this information

5) Create Stage using ACCOUNTADMIN Role or SYSADMIN (must have USAGE on SI)



*Snowflake Console II*

- Create Snowpipes pointing to source folders in S3

- Get SQS ARNs for each pipe

- Create Event Notifications in S3

*PythonAnywhere*

- Go to PythonAnywhere

- Change S3 Bucket Name

- Deploy WebSite

- Send Website Link and tell everyone to fill the form


*See Data flowing in Snowflake*

- Go to Snowflake and Check Copy History for Both tables

- Query WEB_APP table

- Query View
